# RSA
RSA encryption and decryption of strings

RSA is a popular public-key cryptosystem, 
The above code is an implementation of RSA algorithm in Python3.
To encrypt anything using RSA, a pair of prime numbers are required. In general, these numbers range starts from 2⁵¹².

This code is completely for Educational purposes, You can use small primes for understand the working.
For the generation of small primes, you can try
```
  $ python3 rsa.py check_primes
```
which lets you to try out different numbers to check if they are prime.
